ðŸ§­ Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) â€“ Dynamic Programming Approach
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project solves the classic Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Dynamic Programming with Bitmasking. The TSP is a well-known NP-hard problem where the objective is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.

ðŸ’» Features
Implements TSP using dynamic programming and bitmasking

Calculates the minimum cost route

Supports N cities (N â‰¤ 20 for feasible runtime)

Simple CLI-based input/output
